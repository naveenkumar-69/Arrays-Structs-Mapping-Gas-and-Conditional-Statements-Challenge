# Arrays-Structs-Mapping-Gas-and-Conditional-Statements-Challenge
The code you provided is a Solidity smart contract that demonstrates the usage of if-else statements and the ternary operator.

The foo function takes an input x and returns a value based on the conditions specified in the if-else statements. If x is less than 10, it returns 0. If x is between 10 (inclusive) and 20 (exclusive), it returns 1. Otherwise, it returns 2.

The ternary function also takes an input _x and returns a value using both an if-else statement and the ternary operator. It first checks if _x is less than 10 and returns 1 if true. If the condition is not met, it returns 2 using the if-else statement. The last line of code demonstrates a shorthand way to achieve the same result using the ternary operator, where _x < 10 ? 1 : 2 means "if _x is less than 10, return 1, otherwise return 2."
